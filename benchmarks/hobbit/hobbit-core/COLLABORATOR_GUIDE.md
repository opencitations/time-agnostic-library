This document contains information for Collaborators of the HOBBIT
project regarding maintaining the code, documentation and issues.

## EditorConfig

The project uses [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) to help define and maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs.  
Please, make sure you are using an [EditorConfig plugin](http://editorconfig.org/#download) for your editor or IDE.  
You can use tools like [eclint](https://github.com/jedmao/eclint) to validate and fix the code before commiting and sending pull requests.
